        Mass unban everyone, or specific people.

        **Arguments**
        - [`ban_reason`] is what the bot looks for in the original ban reason to qualify a user for an unban. It is case-insensitive.

        When [botname] is used to ban a user, the ban reason looks like:
        `action requested by aikaterna (id 154497072148643840). reason: bad person`
        Using `[p]massunban bad person` will unban this user as "bad person" is contained in the original ban reason.
        Using `[p]massunban aikaterna` will unban every user banned by aikaterna, if [botname] was used to ban them in the first place.
        For users banned using the right-click ban option in Discord, the ban reason is only what the mod puts when it asks for a reason, so using the mod name to unban won't work.

        Every unban will show up in your modlog if mod logging is on for unbans. Check `[p]modlogset cases` to verify if mod log creation on unbans is on.
        This can mean that your bot will be ratelimited on sending messages if you unban lots of users as it will create a modlog entry for each unban.
