# InstantCommands

This is the InstantCommands cog for Red, a tool that can load and store commands or listeners directly from a code snippet sent through Discord.

If you're used to add commands using the eval command, you might like this cog, since what you adds stay loaded after reboot!

**This cog is made for those who know Python and are used to make cogs and commands. If you don't know coding, this is not for you.**

There is a detailed documentation, covering all commands in details, please read this if you want to know how commands works in details: https://laggron.red/instantcommands.html

## Installation and quick start

`[p]` is your prefix.

1.  Install the repo if it's not already done.
    ```
    [p]repo add Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs https://github.com/retke/Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs v3
    ```

2.  Install and load InstantCommands
    ```py
    [p]cog install Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs instantcmd
    # Type "I agree" if requested
    # wait for your bot to install the cog
    [p]load instantcmd
    ```

InstantCommands is now installed!

A few things to keep in mind when making commands and listeners:
-   **Do not add `self` as an argument to your command, only `ctx`.**
-   **Return the command/listener object at the end of your code.**
-   Some modules and values are available in your code:
    -   `bot` (instance of `redbot.core.commands.Bot`, same as with eval)
    -   `discord`
    -   `redbot.core.commands`
    -   `redbot.core.checks`
-   Config can be used in your code. Example:
    ```py
    from redbot.core import Config

    conf = Config.get_conf(None, 9549856112, cog_name="InstantCommands")
    conf.register_global(the_answer=42)

    @commands.command()
    async def deepthough(ctx):
        """
        What is the answer?
        """
        answer = await conf.the_answer()
        await ctx.send(f"The answer to the life, the universe and everything is {answer}.")
    
    return deepthough
    ```
    Some things to be careful when using Config:
    -   **Use `InstantCommands` as the cog name, like in the example.**
    -   **Do not use `260` as your identifier since it's the one used by the cog.**
    -   Be sure to know what you're doing, you have less control on these commands.

## Examples

```
[p]instantcmd create
```

Once the bot asks for it, you have 15 minutes to send your code.

```py
# command example

@commands.command()
@checks.admin()
async def addrole(ctx, *, role: discord.Role):
    """
    Add a role to the whole server.
    """
    for member in ctx.guild.members:
        try:
            await member.add_roles(role)
        except discord.errors.Forbidden:
            pass

return addrole
```

```py
# listener example

async def on_member_join(member):
    guild = member.guild
    role = guild.get_role(142006827155062784)
    await member.add_roles(role, reason="Autorole")

return on_member_join
```
